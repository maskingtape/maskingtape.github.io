The brief on this project was to not only create a series of CSS themes (HTML templates and CSS styles), but to structure these in a way so they could be easily added to new projects.

## Process

<figcaption>Example of a CSS theme created - viewed on iPhone</figcaption>
<img src="/images/satya-iphone-big.png" alt="" height="306" class="image-default">
</figure>

The organisation, [Dharmafly](http://dharmafly.com) uses [Github](http://github.com) to maintain version control on many code projects. I used Github's in-build [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to create the templates and develop the specification for the automation process.

Developers could then write their documentation using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), which is easily readable (for example, it's [used by the UK government](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/02/28/marking-one-year-since-the-inside-government-beta/) by their website content editors).

The developers would then choose a theme, and other project settings, then run the automation. The site would be built.

</figure>

The CSS was build so the minimum amount of images would be used, SVG was chosen for graphic elements, so that colour theming would be simple. I wrestled with techniques such as SVG background images, and SVG data URIs to achieve this.
