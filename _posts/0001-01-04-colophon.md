<p class="overview">{{ page.overview }}</p>

This site is entirely static HTML, with CSS for styling. 

It contains no decorative images, all images are informational (the screenshots of websites).

There's very little javascript (only used to load the font), and only one 20kb font file.

## How the Minimalism was achieved

The static HTML is rendered using the [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org) templating system and constructed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html).

You can see [the framework on github](https://github.com/maskingtape/portfolio).

The CSS is rendered using SASS. The [scss file](https://github.com/maskingtape/portfolio/blob/master/css/styles.scss) contains the variables for colours and mixins for items such as the generated coloured blocks to denote the site section.

[The main site HTML template](https://github.com/maskingtape/portfolio/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) contains all common elements such as the navigation and the footer and the logo, which is four lines of markup and unlike a png image, will scale.
